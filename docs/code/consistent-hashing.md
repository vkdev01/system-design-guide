<p class="lead">A ring with virtual nodes, so adding a cache node moves a slice of the
keyspace instead of all of it.</p>

# Consistent hashing

`hash(key) % N` is the trap. Adding one node to a ten-node cluster changes N, which remaps almost
every key, which means the cache is empty, which means the origin is hit by every request at once.
That is how a routine scale-up becomes an incident.

Consistent hashing puts nodes and keys on the same ring; a key belongs to the next node clockwise.
Adding a node moves only the keys in its arc — roughly 1/N.

Virtual nodes are not optional. With ten physical points the arcs are wildly uneven, and a dead
node dumps its entire keyspace on one unlucky neighbour. Giving each node around 150 points evens
the distribution and spreads a failure across all survivors.

## The code

```python
"""Consistent hashing with virtual nodes.

`hash(key) % N` remaps almost every key when N changes, so adding one node to a
ten-node cache cluster sends 90% of the keyspace to the origin at once.
Consistent hashing places nodes and keys on a ring, so adding a node moves only
the keys in its arc -- roughly 1/N.

Virtual nodes are not optional. With ten physical points the arcs are wildly
uneven; giving each node ~150 points evens the distribution and, more
importantly, spreads a dead node's keys across all survivors instead of dumping
them on one neighbour.

## What to notice

- `get_nodes` walks clockwise to produce a replication set, which is what lets a node failure be a
  cache miss rather than a cache wipe.
- `bisect` gives O(log n) lookup on a sorted list of ring points, which is fast enough that nobody
  has to build a tree.
- The test asserts that adding a fifth node moves between 12% and 28% of keys. That band is the
  property being protected: roughly 1/5, and nowhere near all of them.

## Exercises

1. Add weights, so a node with twice the memory receives twice the keys.
2. Implement bounded-load consistent hashing, which caps the keys any node can own — the fix for
   the remaining imbalance that virtual nodes leave.
3. Measure the distribution with 10, 50 and 150 virtual nodes, and plot the spread.
