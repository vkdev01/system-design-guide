<p class="lead">A three-state machine that stops calling a dependency it has decided is
dead, and probes carefully before trusting it again.</p>

# Circuit breaker

A failing dependency has two costs: the error, and the time you spend waiting for it. With a
30-second timeout and 200 threads, a dead dependency exhausts your pool in seconds and your service
goes down with it. The breaker turns an unbounded wait into an instant decision.

Two details are usually missing from examples and always needed in production. A **minimum
volume**, so one failure out of two requests does not trip the circuit. And a **fallback**, because
a breaker without one just relocates the error — the user still sees a failure, you have only
changed its shape.

## The code

```python
"""A circuit breaker.

    closed  -> calls pass through, failures are counted
    open    -> calls fail immediately, without touching the dependency
    half    -> a limited number of probes decide whether to close again

Two details that are usually missing from examples and always needed in
production: a *minimum volume* before the circuit may open (so one failure out
of two requests does not trip it), and a *fallback*, because a breaker without a
fallback only relocates the error.

## What to notice

- `min_volume` is checked before the failure ratio, which is what stops a single blip from opening
  the circuit.
- The half-open state admits a bounded number of probes. Letting all traffic through on recovery
  is how a recovering service is killed a second time.
- Failures are recorded under the same lock as the state read, so the count and the decision cannot
  disagree.
- `fallback` is a parameter of `call`, not a property of the breaker, because the right fallback
  differs per call site.

## Exercises

1. Add jitter to the cool-down so a fleet of instances does not probe simultaneously.
2. Distinguish counted failures from ignored ones — 4xx responses should not open the circuit.
3. Add a metric: time spent open, and the rate at which the fallback is served. A breaker open for
   a week means a feature has been dead for a week.
