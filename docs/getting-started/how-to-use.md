<p class="lead">The conventions this guide uses, and three different ways to read it
depending on how much time you have.</p>

# How to use this guide

## The shape of a page

Content pages share a skeleton, so you can skim them:

1. **A one-sentence summary** in a coloured bar under the title.
2. **What it is** — the mechanism, in plain language, no product names required.
3. **When to reach for it** — the conditions that justify it, and the conditions that
   do not.
4. **Trade-offs** — always at least three, each naming what you give up.
5. **Interview soundbite** — the sentence to say out loud.
6. **Where to go next** — related pages.

If you only have two minutes, read the summary and the trade-offs.

## Conventions

!!! note "Assumptions are labelled"
    Any number describing a real system's scale is an assumption, not a measurement.
    Where you see "assume 10M DAU", treat it as a knob to turn, not a fact to memorise.

!!! tip "Soundbites are meant to be stolen"
    The *say it like this* lines are written to be spoken verbatim. They are short on
    purpose — a candidate who says one clear sentence and then stops scores better than
    one who says four hedged ones.

!!! warning "Out of scope"
    Hardware, kernel tuning, and ML systems are out of scope. This guide assumes
    application-level engineering and the infrastructure an application engineer
    actually operates.

Diagrams are Mermaid, written inline in the Markdown. They render on the site and stay
in version control next to the prose that describes them.

## Three reading paths

**One week to the interview.** [Anatomy of the interview](interview-format.md) → [the
answering framework](answering-framework.md) → [trade-off cheat
sheet](../interview/trade-off-cheatsheet.md) → three case studies out loud, timed. Skip
everything else. This path works because the trade-off sheet is a compressed version of
the whole guide.

**Learning properly, over a month.** Follow the [study plan](study-plan.md):
Fundamentals, then Building blocks, then the twelve patterns, then case studies with the
book closed.

**Looking up one answer.** Use search. Every page stands alone at the top; the first
screen is written for the reader who arrived from a search engine mid-task.

## A note on the code samples

The [code section](../code/index.md) contains short, tested Python implementations of
the mechanisms that are easiest to describe and hardest to get right: exponential
backoff with jitter, a token bucket, a circuit breaker state machine, an idempotency
store, consistent hashing, shard routing, and an LRU cache.

They are teaching code, not library code — no thread pools, no async, no configuration.
Each is forty to eighty lines and has a test. The point is to make the failure modes
concrete: you can watch a token bucket refuse the eleventh request.
