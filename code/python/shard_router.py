"""Shard routing with logical shards mapped to physical nodes.

The trick that makes sharding survivable: create many more logical shards than
physical nodes (1,024 logical shards on 16 nodes, say), and keep the mapping in
a small table. Growing the cluster is then a metadata change plus background
data movement, not a re-key of every row.

Routing by `hash(key) % number_of_nodes` instead means that going from 16 nodes
to 17 relocates almost every key.
