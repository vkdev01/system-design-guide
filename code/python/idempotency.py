"""An idempotency store.

The contract: the client sends a key, the server performs the operation at most
once, and a replay returns the *original* response rather than recomputing it.

The critical property is that claiming a key is atomic. A read-then-write check
races, and it races exactly when it matters -- two duplicate requests arriving
together. Here `claim()` is a single locked insert, standing in for the unique
constraint you would use in a real database:

    INSERT INTO idempotency (scope, key) VALUES (?, ?)   -- unique index
    ... in the same transaction as the business write ...

If the insert violates the constraint, the operation already happened (or is
happening) and the stored response is returned instead.
